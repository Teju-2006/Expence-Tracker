# Student-Performance-Analyzer
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
    Educational institutions often lack simple, explainable systems to quickly identify students who are academically at risk. Existing systems may rely on raw scores without actionable insights.
This project addresses that gap by building a transparent, rule-based evaluation system that not only assesses performance but also explains why a student is underperforming and how they can improve.

PROJECT GOAL:
To design and implement a data-driven, rule-based system that evaluates student academic performance using key parameters and provides explainable insights to identify at-risk students and suggest improvements.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES:
> To preprocess and analyze student academic data
> To design a custom rule-based scoring mechanism for performance evaluation
> To classify students into performance risk categories
> To generate human-readable insights and recommendations
> To visualize overall performance distribution
